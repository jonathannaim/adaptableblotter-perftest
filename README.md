# AdaptableBlotter.JS Performance Monitor

Use this repository to test the performance of AdaptableBlotter.JS (running on top of OpenFin's Hypergrid and using dummy data).

You can stipulate the number of columns and the number of rows, and set the 'ticking rate' of the Blotter.

You can additionally see how many Conditional Styles are running at any one time (and of course add your own) and also monitor the framerate of the Blotter.

The columns with a bold font ('String Column1', 'Int Column2') are editable.

The Adaptable Blotter is free for development (and proof of concept) use.  And we also offer a free Community Licence for students in full time education, charities and open-source projects.  However, for all other usage, an annual licence must be purchased. (This licence covers both AdaptableBlotter.NET and AdaptableBlotter.JS versions, and offers regular updates and full support).  
Please see the LICENSE file for more information or contact the Adaptable Tools Sales Team at sales@adaptabletools.com.

Further information about AdaptableBlotter.JS, and full Help, is available atÂ www.adaptabletools.com.
